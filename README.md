# Context-Search
This repository contains the following :
- A Jupyter Notebook in which I carried out most of my tasks (the first draft).
- The dataset I worked with, both in the original and processed forms.
- Code for creating APIs using FastAPI for this project.

The idea is simple : **Use NER to make search easier from a UX point of view** 

Here is an example work of the Entity Recognition :

Here is an example of how the APIs work (of course, everything is done on localhost) :
